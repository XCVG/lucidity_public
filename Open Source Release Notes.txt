# What is this?

This is the source code (and other assets) for Shattered - Why Not Me (https://xcvg.itch.io/shattered), my entry to Magical Girl Game Jam way back in 2020!

# What do I do with this?

That's up to you! I'm providing this as an example of CommonCore (https://github.com/XCVG/commoncore) although it's pretty old, and just because. Part of the deal is that I'm not providing any sort of support for this, just throwing it out there.

# Missing pieces

Because of licensing or other logistics issues, there are a few files not included in this release:

**Mobile Tree Package (Assets/Objects/ThirdParty/laxer tree pkg)**

You will need to download the package from the Asset Store if you want to have trees. I'm not sure if any customizations have been made that may require tweaking or relinking to get the trees showing up properly again.

**Apocalypse & Chill Cover (Assets/Objects/Lucidity/Misc)**

The horrendous MSPaint-looking Apocalypse & Chill cover has been removed. This will result in a missing texture in a hard to find corner of one level. If you really want it back, I think I did post it in Twitter at some point, or you can rip it from the game files.

**Test sword (Assets/Objects/Lucidity/TestSword)**

The early test sword was probably made from commercial Doom assets and has been removed because of that. It appeared in a few pre-release screenshots, but is not used in the final game.

**DevConsole (Assets/Plugins/DevConsole)**

This is a third-party asset that is not included, except for a config file with settings for this game. You can grab it from the Asset Store (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/gui/devconsole-2-16833). Note that this version does not work with the latest version of Unity. I have received permission from the author, Antonio Cobo, to update this asset to work with newer versions of Unity. There should be a link to the updated packages in the CommonCore Modules repository (https://github.com/XCVG/commoncore-modules). 

**Music (Assets/Resources/DynamicMusic)**

The music used in the game is not included. All the music used is listed in CREDITS, though without track names. Those can be found in a separate file included with this release.

**Credits Video (Assets/Shared/Videos)**

The end/credits video is not included. You might be able to pull this from a built version of the game. I'm not sure if the game will fail gracefully or break without it.

**XCVG Systems logos (Assets/UI/Graphics/xcvgsys2018_pot_dark.png, Assets/UI/Graphics/xcvgsys2018_pot_light.png)**

The XCVG Systems logos are not included, because these are mine and you can't use them :P

# License and applicability

Shattered itself is licensed under the MIT License, the full text of which is located in COPYING.txt. This includes all the original art in Assets/Objects/Lucidity, all art and game data in Assets/Resources except for the sounds in Assets/Resources/DynamicSound, all scene data and code in Assets/Scenes, all game data and code in Assets/Shared (excluding the textures in Assets/Shared/Textures), and the graphics in Assets/UI/Graphics except for the loadwheel*.png graphics which are derived from a CC0 asset and can also be considered CC0. For the sake of completeness, the metadata and settings in Packages and ProjectSettings may also be considered to fall under the MIT License.

The original graphics will likely be released formally under CC-BY or another license at some point. If you need them under another license badly, please contact me!

CommonCore core code, found under CommonCore, CommonCoreGame, and CommonCoreModules, is dual-licensed under the MIT license and CC-BY. For all practical intents and purposes it can be considered to fall under the same licensing as the rest of the game. Note that there are a few resources and code files in these folders that are third-party and fall under other licenses. See the Documentation folder, which comes from upstream, for details.

Third-party textures, sounds, and libraries fall under their respective licenses. You can find info about this in CREDITS.txt or in the Documentation folder depending on if the asset in question is exclusive to Shattered or comes from upstream.
