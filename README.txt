## Gameplay

## Controls

Mouse to look
WASD to move
Mouse1 to attack, Mouse2 to power attack
Space to jump
Shift to power dash
Shift+Space to power jump

At any point, you may open the menu with Escape. You can also skip through cutscenes with Space or Enter.

## The Story So Far

The daughter of a minor noble, Lady Briella Brukton dreams of being a true knight, slayer of evil and protector of the innocent. By day, she fakes her way through the lessons and duties expected of a lady. By night, she duels trees and smithy's boys with a stick. She dreads the day when she will be married, which grows nearer each day. But soon, she will find herself in a fight she never asked for, with powers she can barely control...

## Cast of Characters

**Lord Marcus Brukton**

The current Lord Brukton, a minor lord sworn to Lord Westerhold holding a small amount of land and perhaps a few hundred bannermen. He has been dour since the death of his wife, Daria, and takes his lordly duties seriously.

**Lady Briella Brukton**

The eldest daughter of Lord Brukton. She dreams of being a true knight, training against trees and smithy's boys whenever she can. Having recently turned eighteen, she will soon be forced to marry, a day which she dreads.

**Lady Annake Brukton**

The younger daughter of Lord Brukton. At eleven, it is said that she resembles her mother. Although they are hardly alike- Annake is a model young lady- she looks up to her sister and loves her dearly.

**Librarian Johann**

A learned man in the service of House Brukton, and in charge of the family's archives.

**Timo**

The captain of the guard at Castle Brukton, and the de facto master-at-arms at the moment.

**Lord Rigan Garrick**

A ruthless but pragmatic lord, also sworn to Lord Westerhold, whose family has been a rival to House Brukton for generations.

**Sir Lar Garrick**

Lord Rigan's cousin, a violent and possibly psychotic knight in his service.


## Content/Trigger Warnings

Although it is a relatively mild game without any obscene or highly NSFW content, it still depicts a not-so-nice medieval fantasy world and contains content some may find disturbing.

* Strong language
* Cartoon violence, including (non-realistic) blood
* Sexist and misogynist remarks
* Crass behaviour and verbal abuse
* Implied intentions of sexual assault
* Mention of arranged/forced marraige

## Known Issues

* Some of the scene transitions and screen fades aren't so nice
* Autosaves are bugged and don't overwrite the correct previous ones
* The castle battle runs like absolute garbage because I never thought I was going to put 200 enemies onscreen and didn't optimize for that.
* It's possible to push a critical character out of the map. They will teleport back.
* There is no "try again" option in the game over screen. Reload the last save instead.
* Some of the dialogue is really shaky
* The 4 key on my keyboard is broken, which makes typing 4 and $ difficult.
